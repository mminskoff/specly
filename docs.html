        <section class="text subgroup" id="introduction">
          <p>It's time for a change. The inefficient, inaccurate, and outdated
          ways that the digital advertising industry communicates ad
          specifications not only leads to countless operational challenges
          that waste resources and negatively impact brand marketing
          initiatives, but they also lead to missed opportunities for brands to
          communicate as effectively as possible with their audiences. I have
          come to realize that one of the most significant reasons for these
          challenges is that the evolution of the language our industry uses to
          describe digital ad specifications has not kept pace with the rapid
          adoption of new devices, new form factors, and new ad
          formats.</p>

          <p>I liken this language challenge to that of a one-year-old at
          daycare who can see and recognize the objects around her but may lack
          the words—and even the alphabet—to accurately label the objects or
          communicate with others about them. She can point at things, pick
          them up, feel their weight and texture, and even share them with her
          friends. But once she gets home, leaving the objects at her daycare,
          she is unable to convey to her parents the things she saw and did
          that day no matter how clearly she might actually remember seeing and
          doing it all; she simply doesn’t know the words.</p>

          <p>Similar to the child in that example, when inventory providers
          have communicated their ad specifications to media and creative
          teams, they have often not had the vocabulary to accurately describe
          them. This fundamental challenge has led to all manner of operational
          inefficiencies, but most importantly, it has (often imperceptibly)
          prevented many brands from fully capitalizing on their digital
          marketing spend. As the digital landscape becomes more intricate with
          each passing quarter, this “death by a thousand cuts” has a dramatic
          and increasingly significant negative impact on the efficiency and
          effectiveness of our entire industry. It’s time for a change.</p><br>

          <h4><i>Enter,</i> <b>Specly</b></h4><br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold">Specly is the industry standard way to
          accurately communicate digital ad specifications.</p>

          <p>For many years, digital advertising has consisted of little more
          than so-called “banners” on desktop web pages. Occasionally, these
          banners can grow larger when tapped (expandable formats), but for the
          most part, indicating a width value and height value is all anyone
          needed to know to design and build a digital display ad.</p>

          <p>Mobile media is just an extension of digital media. But the unique
          ways that mobile ad placements can function with regard to device
          orientation, the multitude of potential screen sizes, locked or
          unlocked ad views, the lack of Flash support and several other
          factors, mandates new methods for communicating digital ad
          specifications and building and serving digital ad creatives. The
          relatively simple lexicon that the digital advertising industry has
          used for the past 15+ years for desktop advertising is simply
          insufficient for today’s ad formats, much less for tomorrow’s. All
          campaign stakeholders benefit from have ad specifications conveyed
          simply, accurately, and comprehensively throughout the campaign
          lifecycle so that timelines, budgets, and user experience can be
          optimized.</p>

          <p><b>Sepcly 1.0</b> covers display and rich media ad formats that
          might be served to websites or apps on virtually any type of digital
          screen: desktop/laptop computers, mobile devices, tablet devices,
          smart TVs, digital signage, etc. Spec.ly even defines ways to specify
          “next generation” digital formats such as responsively designed
          creatives and multi-screen ad experiences. Specly will continue to
          evolve and grow over time to help every facet of our industry with
          the development of new ad formats and technologies to improve the
          entire operational lifecycle of bringing digital ad campaigns to
          market.</p>

          <h3>Specly 1.0</h3><br>

          <p>Specly is the industry standard way to accurately communicate
          digital ad specifications.</p>

          <p>Specly v1.0 defines a standard language for describing digital ad
          specifications with a focus on the accuracy and completeness of ad
          dimensions.</p>

          <p>Specly v1.0 can be used for describing the dimensions of banner
          ads, initial/collapsed banners, expanded panels, orientation-aware
          layouts, fluid ad layouts with variable sizes, responsively designed
          ads, and even experimental, multiscreen ad units.</p>

          <p>Nearly everyone involved in the operations of the digital ad
          campaign lifecycle has the need to communicate accurate and complete
          ad specs to a client, colleague, or partner. Specly gives us the
          tools to do just that.</p>

          <p>Let’s dive in!</p>

          <div class="subgroup" id="simpleBanner">
            <div class="example1">
            <h4 class="exampleHead"><b style="font-style: italic">Example 1:
            simple banner</b><i></i></h4><img class="fig1" src=
            "images/examples/specly_fig1.svg"></div><br>

            <p>Example 1 illustrates a simple banner advertisement with a width
            of 300 pixels and a height of 250 pixels.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>In Specly an “x” character is a special symbol used to
              separate width dimensions from height dimensions.</li>

              <li>In Specly, width dimensions are always listed before height
              dimensions.</li>

              <li>Each pair of width/height values is referred to as a layout.
              As we’ll see below, a single creative design may contain multiple
              layouts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Specly borrows heavily from existing conventions in common use
            today. Specly strives to be additive and complementary to the
            things we already know.</p><br>

            "font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Example 2: expandable
            creative</h4><img class="fig2" src=
            "images/examples/specly_fig2.svg"></div><br>

            <p>Example 2 specifies an expandable advertisement that begins with
            a 300x50 collapsed panel and expands to a 300x300 expanded
            panel.</p><br>

            <ul>
              <li>Specly refers to each grouped set of dimensions as a panel.
              The panels above contain only one layout each, but as we’ll see
              in the following examples, a single panel may encapsulate more
              than one layout.</li>

              <li>The word <span style="font-style: italic">to</span> is a
              special keyword in Specly that separates two ad panels from one
              another.</li>

              <li>The ad’s collapsed panel is always to the left of the to
              keyword, and the expanded panel is to the right.</li>

              <li>The <span style="font-style: italic">to</span> keyword also
              inherently denotes that an ad is an expandable unit since the to
              keyword is only ever used with expandable advertisements.</li>
            </ul>

            creative and multi-screen creative</h4><img class="fig3" src=
            "images/examples/specly_fig3.svg"></div><br>

            <p>Example 3 specifies either a companion placement or a
            multi-screen placement. These are placements where two ad panels
            are both simultaneously visible, and may even interact with one
            another.</p><br>

            <ul>
              <li>In Specly, the word <span style=
              "font-style: italic">with</span> is a special keyword used to
              separate primary and secondary ad panels in multi-screen ad
              placements or companion ad placements.</li>

              <li>At the time of this writing, multi-screen placements are
              still considered experimental. Placements with companion ads are
              more common, especially with video inventory.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="exampleHead"><b style="font-style: italic">Example 4:
            dual-layout panels</b><i></i></h4><img class="fig4" src=
            "images/examples/specly_fig4.svg"></div><br>

            <p>Example 4 specifies an expandable creative that begins with a
            300x250 collapsed banner and expands to an orientation aware
            expanded panel that should contain two layouts: (1) a 768x1024
            layout for portrait (<span>P:</span>) orientation and a 1024x768
            layout for landscape (<span>L:</span>) orientation. This example
            also illustrates another special Specly keyword, the ampersand
            (<span>&amp;</span>).</p><br>

            <ul>
              <li>In Specly, the ampersand (<span>&amp;</span>) is a special
              symbol that separates layouts in orientation-aware panels. The
              ampersand is used when an orientation-aware panel can not be
              locked in one orientation and creative appearing in that panel
              must be designed and built with consideration for both layouts.
              The ampersand also implies that when the expanded panel is first
              shown, it will appear in the layout matching the device’s current
              orientation.</li>

              <li>The <i><span>P:</span></i> prefix—with a capital “P” and a
              colon—is used to denote the dimensions of the ad layout when the
              device is in portrait orientation. The P: prefix is optional. The
              size of the portrait orientation layout is always listed
              first.</li>

              <li>The <i><span>L:</span></i> prefix—with a capital “L” and a
              colon—is used to denote the dimensions of the ad layout when the
              device is in landscape orientation. The size of the landscape
              orientation layout is always listed to the right of the ampersand
              separator.</li>

              <li>Note that dual-layout, orientation-aware panels are not
              inherently limited to the secondary, expanded panels. Any panel
              in a given creative may be required to consider more than one
              layout, even a non-expanding panel, or the collapsed panel of an
              expandable creative. But in Specly, a collapsed panel with more
              than one layout would be specified identically to any other panel
              with more than one layout.</li>
            </ul>
          </div><br>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="subgroup" id="Size">
            <div class="example5">
            <h4 class="exampleHead" style=
            "font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Example 5: Size
            ranges</h4><img class="fig5" src=
            "images/examples/specly_fig5.svg"></div><br>

            <p>Example 5 introduces the notion of layout dimensions that have a
            size range. This is a common scenario in mobile creatives that are
            designed to “full page” where “full page” may vary depending on
            myriad factors, such as device model, browser name, operating
            system version, etc.</p><br>

            <p>Example 5 is actually a real-world Specly for a mobile web, iPad
            ad placement. Both the portrait and landscape layouts in the
            expanded panel have variable heights that range between the min and
            max possible heights—depending on iOS version and user
            configuration settings—for the Safari browser on an iPad in both
            iOS 6 and iOS 7.</p><br>

            <ul>
              <li>Specly surrounds <i>size ranges</i> with square brackets:
              <i><span>[</span></i> and <i><span>]</span></i>. The minimum and
              maximum sizes of the layout’s given dimension are separated from
              each other by a dash/minus sign: <span>-</span>. The minimum size
              appears to the left of the dash, and the maximum size appears in
              the right of the dash.</li>
            </ul>
          </div><br>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="subgroup" id="Safe">
            <div class="example6">
            <h4 class="exampleHead" style=
            "font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Example 6: Safe
            area</h4><img class="fig6" src=
            "images/examples/specly_fig6.svg"></div><br>

            <p>Example 6 illustrates the use of the “<i><span>S:</span></i>”
            prefix that specifies the dimensions of a required safe area for
            the ad creative. Everything before the <i><span>S:</span></i>
            prefix describes the characteristics of the ad placement’s physical
            boundaries.</p><br>

            <p>A <i>safe area</i> is often used as a means to help streamline
            the creative design and development process. A single layout is
            designed to fill the ad placement in both orientations and a
            vertically- and smaller, horizontally-centered safe area is used to
            contain all the “main elements” of an ad creative, such as logos,
            interactive elements, animations, etc. that need to remain visible
            at all times and in all use cases of screen size, browser viewport
            size, device orientations, etc. Any creative elements that lie
            outside of the safe area (background images, etc.) may be cropped
            or covered in various use cases.</p><br>

            <ul>
              <li>In Specly, a <i>safe area</i> layout is entered after all
              other layouts within a given panel.</li>

              <li>To help with legibility, a safe area layout should be
              enclosed in parenthesis: <i>(</i> and <i>)</i>.</li>

              <li>A <i>safe area</i> is always a single, fixed size; a <i>safe
              area</i> never contains a <i>size range</i>.

                <ul>
                  <li>A <i>safe area</i> always has a fixed width that is less
                  than the smallest minimum width of all layouts in the same
                  panel.</li>

                  <li>A <i>safe area</i> always has a fixed height that is less
                  than or equal to the minimum height of all layouts in the
                  same panel.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>Whenever a safe area is specified as part of an Specly ad
              specification, it is implied that using the safe area is
              required. Never specify a safe area in Specly if using a safe
              area is optional.</li>

              <li>Note that creative professionals may optionally choose to use
              a single layout, <i>safe area</i> design even within ad panels
              that do not require them, but doing so would be a design strategy
              at the discretion of the creative professional.</li>

            designed ad creative</h4><img class="fig7" src=
            "images/examples/specly_fig7.svg"></div><br>

            <p>Example 7 illustrates the specification for a responsively
            designed ad creative that is designed to render properly within
            three fixed placement sizes: 300x50, 320x50, and 300x250.</p><br>

            <p>One responsively designed ad creative can be served into
            multiple placement sizes; it’s as if multiple creative sizes (or
            size ranges) are stored “inside” a single ad creative that can be
            trafficked to all compatible placement sizes. All of the
            intelligence about how the creative should be displayed in a given
            ad placement is implemented within the ad creative.</p><br>

            <p>Responsive design methodologies use the the term breakpoint in
            reference to the logical separation of each separate size (or size
            range) that a responsive ad creative is built for. Specly uses the
            forward-slash character “/“ as a special symbol to signify a
            breakpoint within a responsively designed ad creative.</p><br>

            <p>Note that there are two breakpoints and three fixed-size layouts
            in Example 7.</p><br>

            <ul>
              <li>In Specly, the forward-slash character “<span>/</span>“ is a
              special symbol used to signify a breakpoint in a responsively
              designed ad creative.</li>

              <li>A responsively designed panel may contain one or more
              layouts, each separated by a breakpoint.</li>

            <p>Example 8 illustrates the specification for a responsively
            designed ad creative that is designed to render properly within
            multiple placement sizes.</p><br>

            <p>Note that there is one breakpoint, one fluid-sized layout, and
            one fixed-size layout in Example 8.</p><br>

            <p>At first glance, this Example 8 may look similar to the previous
            Example 7, and it is; the differences between Example 7 and Example
            8 are subtle, but important to understand.</p><br>

            <p>Since this ad creative in Example 8 uses a fluid-width in Layout
            #1, this ad creative is more flexible (pun intended) and could
            therefore be displayed not just in three placement sizes (300x50,
            320x50, and 300x250) but instead in any of the following 22
            (theoretical) placement sizes:</p><br>
            <img class="tableImage" src="images/examples/table.svg"><br>

            <p>The fluid-width that is applied in Layout #1 makes this ad
            creative compatible with a range of placement sizes.</p><br>

            <ul>
              <li>Specly is designed to accommodate the specification of
              responsively designed ad creatives that use fluid layouts between
              each breakpoint.</li>

            <p>Example 9 illustrates the specification for a responsively

            sizes in both mobile websites and mobile apps.</p><br>

            <p>While exceptionally long, this line of Specly accurately and
            completely illustrates the specifications for an expandable ad
            creative that could be trafficked to the vast majority of mobile
            and tablet ad placements available today.</p><br>

            <ul>
              <li>Note that it is exceptionally important not to confuse the
              separate purposes of the <span>/</span> and the

                <ul>
                  <li>The <span>/</span> symbol is used to separate layouts
